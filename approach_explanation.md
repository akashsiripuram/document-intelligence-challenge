# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System

## Methodology Overview

Our system implements a multi-stage approach to extract and prioritize document sections based on persona-specific requirements and job-to-be-done tasks.

## Core Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF for efficient text extraction with page number tracking
- **Section Detection**: Implements pattern-based section identification using regex patterns for headers (ALL CAPS, numbered sections, title case, colon endings)
- **Content Structuring**: Organizes extracted content by document, page, and section hierarchy

### 2. Persona Profile Creation
- **Role Analysis**: Maps persona roles to domain-specific keyword sets (travel planner, researcher, student, analyst)
- **Task Decomposition**: Extracts primary focus areas (planning, analysis, learning, research) and secondary focus areas (group activities, budget consciousness, time sensitivity)
- **Keyword Expansion**: Combines role-based keywords with task-specific terms for comprehensive matching

### 3. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
Our multi-factor scoring system evaluates sections based on:
- **Keyword Matching (40% weight)**: Direct overlap between content and persona keywords
- **Primary Focus Alignment (30% weight)**: Alignment with main task objectives
- **Secondary Focus Relevance (20% weight)**: Match with contextual requirements
- **Content Quality (10% weight)**: Length-based penalty to prefer substantial content

### 4. Section Ranking and Selection
- **Global Ranking**: Sorts all sections across documents by relevance score
- **Top-K Selection**: Selects top 5 most relevant sections for final output
- **Importance Assignment**: Assigns ranks 1-5 based on relevance scores

### 5. Subsection Refinement
- **Sentence-Level Analysis**: Scores individual sentences within selected sections
- **Content Distillation**: Extracts top 5 most relevant sentences per section
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures minimum content length while maintaining relevance

## Technical Implementation

### Natural Language Processing
- **NLTK Integration**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
- **TF-IDF Ready**: Framework supports vector-based similarity for future enhancements
- **Pattern Recognition**: Rule-based approach for reliable section header detection

### Performance Optimization
- **CPU-Only Design**: Lightweight implementation using scikit-learn and NLTK
- **Memory Efficiency**: Processes documents sequentially to minimize memory footprint
- **Fast Execution**: Optimized for sub-60 second processing on 3-5 document collections

### Scalability Features
- **Generic Architecture**: Handles diverse document types and persona combinations
- **Extensible Keyword System**: Easy addition of new roles and focus areas
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable weights and selection criteria

## Key Innovations

1. **Persona-Centric Scoring**: Unlike generic document ranking, our system specifically tailors relevance to user roles and tasks
2. **Multi-Level Analysis**: Combines document-level, section-level, and sentence-level analysis for precise content extraction
3. **Context-Aware Refinement**: Subsection analysis considers both content relevance and presentation quality

This approach ensures that extracted sections directly address the specific needs of different personas while maintaining high content quality and relevance for their designated tasks.
